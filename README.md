# SegmentationGAN
A Semantic Segmentation project that uses a GAN to carry out the segmentation.

The Idea is to use a GAN instead of a pixel-wise calssifier for semantic segmentation. In this project DenseNet121 is used as the backbone. One branch is a classifier that generates the
label for the image and the second branch upsamples the feature maps generated by densenet and generates an output trimap.
